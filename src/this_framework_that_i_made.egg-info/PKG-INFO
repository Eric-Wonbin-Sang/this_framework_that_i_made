# This Framework That I Made

My Main Goal: get, set, combine, stream and/or execute anything or everything easily anywhere

Like audio for example.
Why on earth is audio such an absolute pain to deal with? Every system has some random limitation and nothing is cross platform except for some things unless something else. Endpoints are standardized, but not controlling them? And an endpoint is either an input or an output unless it's not??? I just want to be able to get raw audio data from my shit, stream it, control it, get app volume, have it be cross platform. Literally every app can do this, and you're telling me everyone has their own special little way of doing that? Dumb, annoying, don't care, I don't care so much I'm going to learn as little as I can to abstract whatever nonsense existed in the past because that stuff will probably never change and as a developer I never want to give this a second thought ever again.

to test this:

```
# create the framework's egg:
pip install -e .

# run the test script:
python -m tests.test
```

# everything under this is out of date, fix!

# computer_recorder

A project for capturing anything on your computer.

Ideally, I want to be able to capture:
 - [X] input audio devices
 - [X] output audio devices
 - [X] webcams
 - [X] monitors
 - [ ] windows
 - [ ] windows with audio
 - [ ] gifs, images, and video
 - [ ] youtube videos
 - [ ] key and mouse logger

And for processing these, I'd want:
 - [ ] ways to view any device output
 - [ ] sending data via NDI
 - [ ] a way to create scenes like OBS
 - [ ] direct streaming to twitch (this is a stretch)

This project heavily utilizes OOP and follows something like this:

- CacherMixin
    - Device
        - Display, SurfaceMixin
            - Display, DisplayType
                - VideoDevice
                    - Monitor via monitor_factory:
                        - ScreenInfoMonitor
                        - MssMonitor
            - ApplicationScreen
       - Camera
       - Chromecast
            - Chromecastspeaker
            - ChromecastMonitor
       - AudioDeviceType
            - AudioDevice
                - Microphone
                - Speaker (which need LoopbackSpeakers)
                - LoopbackSpeaker
- Users
    - Viewers
        - SurfaceMixin
            - Recorder
                - Xvid Recorder
            - AudioVisualizer
                - AudioGraphVisualizer
    - Senders
        - AudioTransmitter
        - AudioNdiTransmitter


NEW STRUCTURE




This structure is obviously very complicated, but the idea is that everything has some 
output which can be formed in some standard way to reuse things that inherently require 
the same data to view, send, etc. 

I think there should definitely be a better name for Device, as I'm not really sure an
application windows should be called a device. 


this is out of date:

look into this:
 - pip install ndi-python

## Note

There is an issue with recording output devices in windows, which is why I had to use the PyAudioWPatch fork of PyAudio. Here's more details in this [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26573556/record-speakers-output-with-pyaudio)

Solution:
 - [PyAudioWPatch](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch) GitHub repo
 - Here is some [example code](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/examples/pawp_record_wasapi_loopback.py) to get Windows speakers to work
